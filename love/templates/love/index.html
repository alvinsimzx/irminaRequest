              <p>You mentioned that I've never formally asked you to be my girlfriend eventhough we've already been dating for over a month now. You also said that you want it to be something so special that you can show it off. Therefore, because we're both Software Engineering nerds, I'm gonna express it in this webpage :D Also, if you want the source code to this webpage, can just tell me. I would gladly show u how i built it with Django >:D</p>

                  <strong>1. You bring so much joy to me </strong> <br>
                  Everytime when I'm with you, I just forget about everything else and could only think about you. You've brought so much joy to my life that I've never had for a long time. Before we even started this, I would always look forward to going out with you. We'd plan our outings spontaneously and even if it meant just chilling in the car talking, it just makes me so happy to be there. After we've gone back already, I would just think about how fun it was and how I want to be with you again and again.

                  <strong>2. You're so cute in so many ways </strong> <br>
                  Although I know you don't like me saying you're chaotic, the chaos you bring to me just makes me like you even more. Whether its mistakenly placing your food orders as self pickup and asking me to help pick it, or just how you drove so fast in a curvy road. You'd either laugh or panic in those chaotic moments, and I just think that's really cute. Besides that, you'd always film tiktok videos every now and then, and I dont know if you intend it to look hot or anything, all I know is that it is so cute and I just fall in love with you even more. You just get cuter every day and it just makes it so hard for me to not fall in love with you ever since. But that doesn't mean you're not hot, you're definitely hot in many ways too :)

                  <strong>3. You somehow still put up with me till today </strong> <br>
                  I don't know bout you, but I'm not sure how anyone can put up with my nerdy lifestyle and constant rants. I talk too much about my keyboards, kpop, crypto and other nerdy stuff. I remember what made me attracted to you was when you mentioned that you'd consider buying me my fav keyboard once we've gotten to know each other a lot more, like maybe after a year of knowing each other. I was surprised actually because I thought you'd just forget about what my interests are cause they're so boring and nerdy. Besides that, I remember ranting a lot to you eventhough we knew each other for a month or so. Similarly, I thought that you'd just distance yourself then but somehow you still put up with my rants for months to come. So yes, thank you so much for all that and it made me like you even more. You're stuck with me and my rants from now on :D

                  <strong>4. You became really comfortable around me </strong> <br>
                  I'm not sure if I've told you before, but I really like to be around people that are comfortable enough to be their true self around me and share their deepest thoughs. You're the one and only person that I've met in such a long time, that wasn't afraid to be your true self around me that quickly and opened up fairly quickly to me. I really love that about you. With that, it made me a lot more comfortable around you. I know there are a lot more things that we have not fully opened up about yet, but I'm so happy to see how comfortable we've become with one another.

                  Uh so, I'm gonna keep the reasoning till here cuz yknow, don't wanna make the page too long. It's a design principle okay. There are a lot more reasons that I like about you but you're gonna have to wait for me to make that list too ;)

              <h2>What are we?</h2>
              <p>Irmina Mitia, you're my favourite person in my life right now and I hope that you'll continue to become just that for a long time. I really like you a lot but I've never expressed it to it ever since we've met. I was too shy and unsure if I should confess because I wasn't sure if you would feel the same. You're the one person that I've thought about a lot and I haven't had this feeling in such a long time. To me, you're just irresistable and with that, I need to ask you something...</p>
